Context: 
In this assignment, you will create a backend application using FastAPI, containerize it with Docker, deploy it in a Kubernetes cluster (Ex: Minikube) with networking and load balancing, and monitor its performance with Prometheus. You will implement, test, and monitor your application by tracking metrics like the number of requests received, CPU usage, and memory usage for each replica.
